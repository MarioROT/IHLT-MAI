        "The SpaCy coreference solver, when applied to this paragraph, functions well in some situations but not in others. For example, it successfully finds all of the correct coreferences for both \"Alice\" and \"her sister\" -- however, it does not find coreferences for the other nouns / noun phrases in the paragraph that have coreferences. For example, \"book\" should have \"it\" twice as a coreference. Additionally, the solver identifies \"it\" as its own entity with coreferences, even though this is an anaphora, with the antecedent of \"book\". One possible reason for this error could potentially be how the sentence is parsed under the hood, resulting in misidentification of noun phrases or pairs of entities and mentions, though given simply the output of the coreference solver, it is impossible to say the true reason for the poor performance.\n"

        "- For the entity `Alice`, the entity is first identified, then the word `she` is used to indicate an action performed by her, and two mentions are made with the word `her` to refer to Alice's sister. Near the end of the paragraph `Alice` is again mentioned by name and, although this could be a complex identification situation because it is mentioned in the middle of a completely different idea, it is correctly grouped with all the other coreferences to Alice.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The second entity that appears in the text is `Alice's siste`\", mentioned twice as `her sister`, in both cases the solver clearly identifies the coreferences in the text, even when in the paragraph the sister has no name assigned or could be confused with one of Alice's coreferences such as `she` or simply `her`.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The last cluster provided by the solver identifies the co-references of the `Alice's sister's book`, where it is first identified as an entity, but its two subsequent co-references are also correctly identified. It is curious how the solver provides context about the whole entity and not only about the name given in the text to this entity. For this parcitular case, the book is first identified as `the book her sister was reading` instead of just `the book`, which helps to resolve ambiguities in case other objects appear that may use similar words to identify their coreferences.\n"
